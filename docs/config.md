The Madock configuration can be stored within a project in the .madock folder.

To do this, you need to manually create a .madock folder and transfer configuration files and database backups from {madock_root}/projects/{project_name} folder, if necessary.

In the future, all configuration changes made through the cli will occur in the file {project_root}/.madock/config.xml

You can also transfer database backups and docker files to the .madock folder.
